# Car Selling Price Predictor: Project Overview
* Created a regression model that predicts a car's selling price (average r-squared = 0.91, average rmse = 234541 rupees) so individuals interested in selling their car have an easier time deciding a selling price for their car.
* The dataset used to train the model was from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/nehalbirla/vehicle-dataset-from-cardekho?select=Car+details+v3.csv). The dataset consists of information about used cars from CarDekho (a website where users can sell or purchase cars in India).
